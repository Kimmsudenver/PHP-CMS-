Hello Everyone.

So this is a project i started on to learn more PHP and SQL, the purpose of this project is to build a Content Management System from scratch, to understand how things work together. 

Ideally this system will be used for student from Metro, CU and CCD as a Craiglist like web, to exchange information, find roomate, trade books and so on.

The final product should have the user side and admin side. The user side will allow user to posting to the web using school email, not any email, for better management. I am not sure how to have the access to the school database yet. 

The admin side will have admins to manage the web contents, postings.

File System:

Including Includes, Public
Includes: include anything that work internally, such as functions, session.

Public: consist of layout folder, which has footer and header.
	other PHP files for different pages.

I have been working on the admin side to do the CRUD on admin area, allow admin to manage the nagivation bar. There is a lot more to do, such as User side, and login in as admin.

My email is kbui3@msudenver.edu. Feel free to contact me any time.
